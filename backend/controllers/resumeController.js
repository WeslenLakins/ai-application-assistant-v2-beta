Achieve this by quantifying the Applicant's accomplishments and contributions in their previous roles, employing the formula: accomplished (X), as measured by (Y), by doing (Z). Maintain the examples provided as a guideline for quantifying achievements:

The revamped resume must be concise, fitting within a one-page limit, unless the users current resume is longer than one-page, and should exclusively focus on resume content without including extraneous information.

  Provide the necessary details as follows:
  
  Job title: ${jobTitle}
  Company: ${company}
  Location: ${location}
  Job description: ${jobDescription}
  
  Current resume:
  ${currentResume}
